<!--
 This HTML document is a custom 404 error page for the library system.
 
 The document has a Bootstrap stylesheet for basic styling.
 
 The title of the page is 'Page Not Found - Library', and the favicon is 'icon.png'.
 
 The body of the document contains a container div that is centered both vertically 
 and horizontally using flexbox.
 The background color of the body is set to '#f8f9fa', which is a light gray color.
 
 The container div has a text-align property set to 'center', which centers the text 
 inside it.

 Inside the container div, there are three elements for displaying the error code, 
 the error message, and a suggestion for what to do next.
 The error code is displayed in a large, bold, red font.
 The error message is displayed in a slightly smaller font and has a margin at the 
 bottom.
 The suggestion is displayed in an even smaller, gray font.

 The error code is '404', the error message is 'Oops! The page you are looking for 
 doesn't exist.', and the suggestion is 'It seems you may have taken a wrong turn. 
 Don't worry... it happens to the best of us.'.

 Below the suggestion, there is a button that redirects the user to the home page 
 ('index.php') when clicked.
